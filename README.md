Todoist Linux
=============

The app is just an Electron wrapper on Todoist's web version.

Installation
------------
* Go to [Releases tab](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases) or [Click here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jzi5g7narop1e83/todoist-linux.zip?dl=0) to start download the latest version
* Choose the one you like (the top one is the latest). `todoist-linux.zip` - is the file you need.
* Just download the archive and unpack it to any place you wish
* Run `Todoist` script

If you wish to add icon to your Gnome3/Cinnamon/Mate menu you can
use `todoist.desktop` file, here in repo. Just replace `<path>` with absolute path
to a folder with the unpacked application.

Shortcuts
---------

* Ctrl+Alt+a - quick add a task (the global one)
* All other shortcuts from Todoist exists

Why???
-------
The main reason is I don't like to have web version opened since I can't easily alt+tab to it.

And I also really wanted to have global shortcuts to quick add a task.

The initial inspiration I got from [this](https://github.com/kamhix/todoist-linux) brilliant package of the same web version.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem maintained at the moment and has some issues with Tray functionality on latest Ubuntu.
