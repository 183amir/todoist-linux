Todoist Linux
=============

The app is just an Electron wrapper on Todoist's web version.

Installation
------------
* Go to [Releases tab](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases)
* Choose the one you like (the top one is the latest)
* Just download the archive and unpack it to any place you wish
* Run `todoist` script

Shortcuts
---------

* Ctrl+Alt+a - quick add a task (the global one)
* All other shortcuts from Todoist exists

Why???
-------
The main reason is I don't like to have web version opened since I can't easily alt+tab to it.

And I also really wanted to have global shortcuts to quick add a task.

The initial inspiration I got from [this](https://github.com/kamhix/todoist-linux) brilliant package of the same web version.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem maintained at the moment and has some issues with Tray functionality on latest Ubuntu.
