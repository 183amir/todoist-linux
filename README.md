Todoist Linux
=============

The app is just an Electron wrapper on Todoist's web version.

Installation
------------
Currently only RPM and DEB packages avilable for x64 arch.

You can download the package on [releases](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases) page or you always can get latest build as:

* [DEB package (Debian/Mint/Ubuntu)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ldv7uf5dxmerqx8/Todoist.deb?dl=0)
* [RPM package (Fedora/Suse)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8m6rxp26bjmfnh/Todoist.rpm?dl=0)
* [Windows portable version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ve97rxd2i1zhlm1/Todoist.exe?dl=0)

Shortcuts
---------

* Ctrl+Alt+a - quick add a task
* Ctrl+Alt+t - show or hide the app window
* All other Todoist's shortcuts exists from inside the app window

Why???
-------
The main reason is I don't like to have web version opened since I can't easily alt+tab to it.

And I also really wanted to have global shortcuts to quick add a task.

The initial inspiration I got from [this](https://github.com/kamhix/todoist-linux) brilliant package of the same web version.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem maintained at the moment and has some issues with Tray functionality on latest Ubuntu.
